Goal: Exploration
=================

The explorer loves seeing what’s around the corner - getting to the top of the
mountain, discovering that secret base inside the cave with the lore biscuit
that no one will see except for them.

If you’re an explorer, you’re in for a treat, but first you'll need to prepare
yourself for the rigors of the wilderness:

- The quest for exotic equipment.

Then enjoy the world of Tyria!

- The quest for map completion
- The quest for the living story
- The quest for mini dungeons
- The quest for meta-events (and world bosses)
- _Optional: The quest for jumping puzzles_

Goal: Living the Story
======================

The story enthusiast is kept interested by a compelling story that motivates
their adventures. The flavor and lore of Tyria and its people only adds to the
intrigue.

First, get yourself geared up so you don’t die on the way!

- The quest for exotic equipment

Then try these quests to get straight to the story:

- The quest for map completion
- The quest for the living story
- The quest for mini dungeons
- The quest for meta-events
- The quest for dungeon mastery and Fractals of the Mists

The Quest for Exotic Equipment
==============================

_You’ll need exotic armor to contribute at your maximum potential in all types
of content._

The quests in this guide will be way more fun if you’re properly geared. You’ll
have that fuzzy feeling that you’re contributing to the team, and that alive
feeling from not dying all the time.

However, this is not a gearing guide.  There are plenty of existing gearing
guides that go into great detail on how to pick the best builds and put them
together in the most cost-efficient way. You can find many of them here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides

## Quest Log

- ~~Decide on your first build~~
- **Get an exotic set of level 80 armor**
- Get an exotic set of level 80 accessories
- Get a level 80 exotic weapon of each type that your class can equip
- Equip all of your weapons with superior sigils
- Equip all of your armor with superior runes (matching set recommended!)

## Tips

1. Decide what kind of build you want to play (see the first section of this
guide, and remember that http://www.metabattle.com is a great resource!)

  If you want to play multiple builds, your quest just got more expensive, but
  at least people will stand in awe as you rip off your Berserker armor to
  reveal the Power/Toughness/Vitality set within as you charge towards Tequatl.
  Tip: If you want a surefire and efficient path through the exotic gearing
  process, check out No-Nonsense Guide to Gearing Up at Level 80.

  Note: Runes for armor and sigils for weapon are crucial to completing your
  gear. Rune sets can add up to 300 stat points to your character (more than one
  exotic chestpiece) but may include other bonuses, while sigils help to give
  your weapons an added punch. Having a set of 6 matching runes provides a much
  larger bonus than a mixed set. Look for runes
  (http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Rune) and sigils
  (http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sigil) that complement your build, keeping in
  mind what you can afford. Some sets may actually cost more than your entire
  armor set, but there are many cheap ones that will provide adequate bonuses.

2. Get the gear you want using one of the following methods. Some gear will come
  with runes and sigils included. Take the price of the runes and the sigils you
  need into account when deciding the most cost-effective way to get your gear.

  * Purchase with gold
  
  Buying gear with gold is a great option if you just want the freedom to play
  the content you want to play.  Almost everything in the game earns you gold -
  even reward tracks in sPvP.  Check out the gold guides above for more
  information.

  * Purchase with karma

  Buying gear with karma* is an option for certain sets.The karma vendors at the
  temples in Orr sell some gear sets. See the wiki for more information. If you
  want them, you’ll need to gather a group in Orr to take the temple that you
  want, and buy your hard earned armor!
  
  * Craft it

  Crafting it is an option at crafting level 400 for all professions except
  Chef. At this point, you can make exotic gear, and you probably have a lot of
  materials lying around from your travels. Crafting yourself a set might not be
  as expensive as you think. Here’s a great resource for leveling crafting
  efficiently: http://www.gw2crafts.net/

  * Earn it by running dungeons

  Buying gear with dungeon tokens will make a lot of sense to veteran MMO
  players.Each dungeon drops a different token that can be used to buy dungeon
  specific armor (with special skin and stat combinations).Running these
  dungeons repeatedly and farming the tokens can be a great way to get the armor
  you want while earning some gold on the side!There is a bit of a 'chicken and
  the egg' problem though – to run dungeons effectively, after all, you do need
  good gear – but there are plenty of friendly groups who will be willing to run
  dungeons with you even if you don’t have optimal gear.That’s one great thing
  about having a guild!

  * Purchase with guild commendations

  Buying gear with guild commendations is useful for berserker weapons and
  certain armor slots. You may purchase exotic backpieces, exotic weapons, or
  profession gear boxes with a mix of gold and guild commendations (earned by
  completing guild missions with your - you guessed it - guild). Just keep in
  mind that guild commendations are limited in supply and can buy other stuff
  too, so think before you spend them. Generally speaking, guild commendations
  should be saved up to buy ascended trinkets due to the limited number you can
  obtain per week, so use them sparingly.

  * Buying gear with badges of honor

  Buying gear with badges of honor* from World vs. World. If you have an
  abundance of badges and a little bit of gold, Weapon Master and Armor Master
  NPCs in the Eternal Battlegrounds and Borderland maps have exotic level 80
  gear with most stat types available. However, these items cannot be forged or
  salvaged, so purchase with care.

  * Pray to the RNG gods for drops from mobs, armor boxes, or the mystic forge

  Finally, exotic gear does drop randomly from mobs, and you can buy random
  armor boxes from vendors like the Laurel vendor (for daily achievements).But
  this can be a slow and indirect method, unless you really just don’t want to
  bother with the above methods, or you’re feeling lucky.And, if you’re feeling
  really lucky, you have a chance of making an exotic in the mystic forge by
  tossing in four of your old rares.(But it’s probably a better idea just to
  sell them and use the money to buy what you really want.)

The Quest for Map Completion
============================

__To see every corner of the game’s stunning artwork, and to get a gold star by
your name.  (Literally.)__

Now for the twist. You’ve been doing the quest for map completion all along. You
probably completed quite a few hearts, vistas, and other map activities while
you were leveling. When you open the map, you’ll see a percentage completion for
the map you’re currently on, and the percentage completion for all of the maps.
I think you know what you have to do.

## Quest Log
- ~~Reach 25% completion~~
- Reach 50% completion
- Reach 75% completion
- Reach 100% completion
- Complete all vistas, skill challenges, and points of interest in Southsun Cove
- Complete all vistas, skill challenges, and points of interest in Dry Top
- Complete all vistas, skill challenges, and points of interest in the Silverwastes

## Goal

- `Gift of Exploration` for `Twilight`
- `Gift of Exploration` for `Sunrise`

## Tips

Map completion is straightforward, but it can be made more interesting with
these weird tricks:

- **Hearts go faster when there are events nearby.** Personally, I try to avoid
  doing a heart by itself. I follow events around the map, and many hearts
  naturally take care of themselves.  It’s more fun that way, and if you plan
  your route, it can be faster too.
- **Mouse over the name of the map** on the world map to see exactly what you
  still need to do.
- **Talk to the heart NPCs.** Heart NPCs often provide context for an area and
  explain why you’re doing what you’re doing. Plus, after you finish a heart
  they turn into merchants that often sell unique items.
- **Look up.** Not just for vistas, which are often on cliffs, but to enjoy the
  beautiful scenery as you complete the map. Increasing your FOV in camera
  settings helps with this.
- Some people really enjoy speed running. There are documented paths for the
  most efficient map completion paths. It’s not something I recommend on a first
  character since you’d be blowing through so much of the game’s content so
  quickly, but it’s an option if it appeals to you. Check out
  [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2twe8d/100_world_completion_no_deaths_in_less_then_30/)
  if it sounds interesting, and check out this website for efficient
  pre-determined routes of each map:
  [Map completion routes](http://darkronins.shivtr.com/forum_threads/1456052)

Tip: Not all maps count for map completion. Most of the newer maps, such as Dry
Top and Southsun Cove don’t have any hearts at all, and don’t show a map
completion percentage. That doesn’t mean they’re not worth exploring--these maps
are some of the most compelling content in the game, with map-wide dynamic
events culminating in big rewards and big bosses.

Tip: When you’ve completed the map, you probably still haven’t seen everything.
Check out the quest for mini dungeons and the quest for jumping puzzles for some
awesome hidden content.

The Quest for Mini Dungeons
===========================
_To find secret areas that aren’t included in Map Completion. (Yes, not
everything of interest is on the map!)_

Quick quiz: How many dungeons are in Guild Wars 2? Seven? Eight? Twenty six!?
Depends on how mini you like your dungeons.

Mini dungeons are explorable areas that are hidden in the open world. There are
puzzles and challenging enemies, and some pretty neat sights and lore. They’re
not going to drop a big chest of gold at the end like a normal, instanced
dungeon, but they do tend to give Explorer achievements.

They’re not marked on the map, and require careful exploration to find. They may
be opened by events, or you may be able to walk right in. Keep your eyes peeled
while you explore the map, and when in doubt, use the tips below!

## Quest Log

- Find at least one mini dungeon without consulting the wiki
- Complete the flame temple tombs mini dungeon
- Complete all mini dungeon Explorer achievements

## Mini Dungeons

- Ascalon
  + Diessa Plateau
    * Flame Temple Tombs (no achievement)
  + Fireheart Rise
    * Rebel's Seclusion
    * Vexa's Lab
  + Plains of Ashford
    * Human's Lament
- Kryta
  + Gendarran Fields
    * Provernic Crypt (no achievement)
  + Kessex Hills
    * Goff's Loot (might have this one)
  + Queensdale
    * Bad Neighborhood
- Maguuma Jungle
  + Caledon Forst
    * Don't Touch the Shin
    * Tears of Itlaocol
  + Metrica Province
    * Old Oola Lab (no achievement; I have the key)
  + Sparkfly Fen
    * Verarium Delves (no chievement; northwest)
- Ruins of Orr
  + Cursed Shore
    * Grounded
    * Forgotten Stream
  + Streams of Devastation
    * Ships of Sorrows
    * The Long Way Around
- Shiverpeak Mountains
  + Dredgehaunt Cliffs
    * Forsaken Fortune
  + Frostgorge Sound
    * Magellan's Memento
  + Lornar's Pass
    * Windy Cave Treasure (I've seen this)

## Tips

- Check the wiki for a list of all of the mini dungeons in the game:
  http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mini-dungeon
- I recommend starting with the Flame Temple Tombs. It’s a pretty interesting
  adventure, and though there’s no achievement, I certainly found it rewarding
  to make it to the end.
- Many of the mini dungeons have achievements for you if you make it to the end.
  Good luck!

The Quest for the Living Story
==============================

_To enjoy a good story. To gain a deeper understanding of the world around you,
and context for why the world is like it is. To earn some unique rewards._

There’s a rich history behind what you see in Tyria, and it’s constantly
changing as the game is updated and new maps, events, and quests are added.
There’s plenty of story to catch up on right now, and when you’re done, you can
speculate with the rest of us on what’s coming up next!

Up until now, ArenaNet has added story in the form of “Living Story Seasons”, in
which new story is added roughly every two weeks. The first season was very
temporary--the world changed rapidly and events came and went. It was very
exciting if you were there, but hard to explain if you weren’t. Luckily, there
are some videos to catch you up in the quest log below, and we can all hope that
it will one day return to the game.

Season 2, on the other hand, will be available forever. If you logged on during
the initial release of each chapter, you received permanent access for free;
otherwise, it will cost you 200 gems per chapter (or the equivalent in gold).
The Season 2 story quests are the best in the game and will set you up for the
upcoming Heart of Thorns expansion, so don’t miss them!

## Quest Log
- Complete your personal story
- Watch this short overview of season one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckEsGyYHRFY
- For more depth, watch these two videos by the venerable Wooden Potatoes on the
  first half of season one
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSicD-CA4lM
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EsWtkj6f2k
- _Optional: Read this synopsis on the wiki for more season one details
  + http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_season_1
- Unlock each episode of season 2
- Complete season 2

Tip: All season two episodes have difficult achievements that give you more
challenging objectives than simply finishing the story. Since these achievements
are not directly relevant to the story, we’ve put them in The Quest for
Achievements and Collections.
