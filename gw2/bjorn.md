# Goal: Combat Generalist

The combat generalist wants to experience all the content that the game has to
offer. They probably don’t have time to absolutely maximize their effectiveness
in every area, but they want a good shot at everything.

If this sounds fun, you’ll probably want to work towards multiple gear sets for
different play types.  You’ll be using the following guides:

- The quest for exotic equipment
- The quest for a legendary weapon
- The quest for Dungeon Mastery and Fractals (to practice your skills in speed
  clearing dungeons)
- The quest for meta-events (to practice your skills in an open world setting)
- The quest for WvW Mastery (to practice your skills in an open-world PvP
  setting)
- The quest for sPvP Mastery (to practice your skills in an arena setting)
- The quest for the world bosses (to practice your skills against the most
  difficult PvE in the game)

# Goal: Exploration

The explorer loves seeing what’s around the corner - getting to the top of the
mountain, discovering that secret base inside the cave with the lore biscuit
that no one will see except for them.

If you’re an explorer, you’re in for a treat, but first you'll need to prepare
yourself for the rigors of the wilderness:

* The quest for exotic equipment

Then enjoy the world of Tyria!

* The quest for jumping puzzles
* The quest for map completion
* The quest for mini dungeons
* The quest for the living story
* The quest for meta-events (and world bosses)

# Goal: Living the Story

The story enthusiast is kept interested by a compelling story that motivates
their adventures. The flavor and lore of Tyria and its people only adds to the
intrigue.

First, get yourself geared up so you don’t die on the way!

* The quest for exotic equipment

Then try these quests to get straight to the story:

* The quest for the living story
* The quest for map completion
* The quest for dungeon mastery and Fractals of the Mists
* The quest for mini dungeons
* The quest for meta-events

# The Quest for Exotic Equipment

_You’ll need exotic armor to contribute at your maximum potential in all types
of content._

The quests in this guide will be way more fun if you’re properly geared. You’ll
have that fuzzy feeling that you’re contributing to the team, and that alive
feeling from not dying all the time.

However, this is not a gearing guide.  There are plenty of existing gearing
guides that go into great detail on how to pick the best builds and put them
together in the most cost-efficient way. You can find many of them here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides

## Quest Log

- ~~Decide on your first build~~
- **Get an exotic set of level 80 armor**
- Get an exotic set of level 80 accessories
- Get a level 80 exotic weapon of each type that your class can equip
- Equip all of your weapons with superior sigils
- Equip all of your armor with superior runes (matching set recommended!)

##Tips

1. Decide what kind of build you want to play (see the first section of this
guide, and remember that http://www.metabattle.com is a great resource!)

  If you want to play multiple builds, your quest just got more expensive, but
  at least people will stand in awe as you rip off your Berserker armor to
  reveal the Power/Toughness/Vitality set within as you charge towards Tequatl.
  Tip: If you want a surefire and efficient path through the exotic gearing
  process, check out No-Nonsense Guide to Gearing Up at Level 80.

  Note: Runes for armor and sigils for weapon are crucial to completing your
  gear. Rune sets can add up to 300 stat points to your character (more than one
  exotic chestpiece) but may include other bonuses, while sigils help to give
  your weapons an added punch. Having a set of 6 matching runes provides a much
  larger bonus than a mixed set. Look for runes
  (http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Rune) and sigils
  (http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sigil) that complement your build, keeping in
  mind what you can afford. Some sets may actually cost more than your entire
  armor set, but there are many cheap ones that will provide adequate bonuses.

2. Get the gear you want using one of the following methods. Some gear will come
  with runes and sigils included. Take the price of the runes and the sigils you
  need into account when deciding the most cost-effective way to get your gear.

  * Purchase with gold
  
  Buying gear with gold is a great option if you just want the freedom to play
  the content you want to play.  Almost everything in the game earns you gold -
  even reward tracks in sPvP.  Check out the gold guides above for more
  information.

  * Purchase with karma

  Buying gear with karma* is an option for certain sets.The karma vendors at the
  temples in Orr sell some gear sets.See the wiki for more information.If you
  want them, you’ll need to gather a group in Orr to take the temple that you
  want, and buy your hard earned armor!
  
  * Craft it

  Crafting it is an option at crafting level 400 for all professions except
  Chef. At this point, you can make exotic gear, and you probably have a lot of
  materials lying around from your travels. Crafting yourself a set might not be
  as expensive as you think. Here’s a great resource for leveling crafting
  efficiently: http://www.gw2crafts.net/

  * Earn it by running dungeons

  Buying gear with dungeon tokens will make a lot of sense to veteran MMO
  players.Each dungeon drops a different token that can be used to buy dungeon
  specific armor (with special skin and stat combinations).Running these
  dungeons repeatedly and farming the tokens can be a great way to get the armor
  you want while earning some gold on the side!There is a bit of a 'chicken and
  the egg' problem though – to run dungeons effectively, after all, you do need
  good gear – but there are plenty of friendly groups who will be willing to run
  dungeons with you even if you don’t have optimal gear.That’s one great thing
  about having a guild!

  * Purchase with guild commendations

  Buying gear with guild commendations is useful for berserker weapons and
  certain armor slots. You may purchase exotic backpieces, exotic weapons, or
  profession gear boxes with a mix of gold and guild commendations (earned by
  completing guild missions with your - you guessed it - guild).Just keep in
  mind that guild commendations are limited in supply and can buy other stuff
  too, so think before you spend them. Generally speaking, guild commendations
  should be saved up to buy ascended trinkets due to the limited number you can
  obtain per week, so use them sparingly.

  * Buying gear with badges of honor

  Buying gear with badges of honor* from World vs. World. If you have an
  abundance of badges and a little bit of gold, Weapon Master and Armor Master
  NPCs in the Eternal Battlegrounds and Borderland maps have exotic level 80
  gear with most stat types available. However, these items cannot be forged or
  salvaged, so purchase with care.

  * Pray to the RNG gods for drops from mobs, armor boxes, or the mystic forge

  Finally, exotic gear does drop randomly from mobs, and you can buy random
  armor boxes from vendors like the Laurel vendor (for daily achievements).But
  this can be a slow and indirect method, unless you really just don’t want to
  bother with the above methods, or you’re feeling lucky.And, if you’re feeling
  really lucky, you have a chance of making an exotic in the mystic forge by
  tossing in four of your old rares.(But it’s probably a better idea just to
  sell them and use the money to buy what you really want.)
