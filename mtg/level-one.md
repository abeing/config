# Mana Bases

- 17-18 lands for a **limited** deck. 24-25 lands for a constructed deck.
- For a 40-card deck, if you really want to have a land that produces a certain
  color of mana in your opening hand, you should play at least nine or ten
  lands that produce that color (eleven to be safe).
- For a 60-card deck, you should play at least fifteen or sixteen lands that
  produce that color (seventeen or eighteen to be safe).

# Combat

- Attack and block aggressively with your creatures. That's what they're for. 

  > When two similar creatures face off, you should usually attack if you can and
  > you should usually block if you can.

- Bluffing is not as big a part of the game as I'd think.

  > People bluff less often than you'd expect and people block less often than
  > you'd expect.

- Use combat tricks on the attack rather than on the defense, as they are most
  effective when the opponent doesn't have all of his mana open.
- Two to four combat tricks in a **limited** deck.
